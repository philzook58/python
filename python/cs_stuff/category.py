# hold category in a data sturcture
# Category is DAG with associative composition operation with identity

# could follow hutton. Edge list and object list and then a head and tail fucntion taking edges to objects

# Or we can define a minimal set of rules and then automate closure
# for example edge f and edge g combine into edge (f, g)
# or define equality (commutativty of paths)

# search for universal structures
